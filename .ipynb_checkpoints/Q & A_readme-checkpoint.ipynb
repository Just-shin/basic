    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Answer-\n",
    "     Operators are special symbols or keywords that are used to carryout specific actions on numbers or variables in python expressions. We used operators to manage, do computation and make decision using data.\n",
    "    Python offers a variety of operators to perform different operations on data such as-\n",
    "    a) ARITHMETIC OPERATORS - Perform basic mathematical calculations. It adds(+),substracts(-),multiply(*),divides(/), modulus(%) which returns the remainder after dividing the left operand by the right operand, exponentiation(**)- it raises the left operand to the power of the right operand.\n",
    "    b) COMPARISION OPERATORS - Compare two operands and return a boolean value i.e., True or False.\n",
    "    Eg - equal to(==) , not equal to(!=), greater than(>), less than(<), greater than or equal to(>=), less than or equal to(<=).\n",
    "    c) LOGICAL OPERATORS - Combine multiple conditions and return a boolean value.\n",
    "    Eg - and(returns True if both operans are True), or(returns True if atleast one of the operand is True), not(Iverts the boolean value of the operand)\n",
    "    d) ASSIGNMENT OPERATORS - Used to assign values to variables.\n",
    "    Example - assingment(=), add and assign(+=), subtract and assign(-=), multiply and assign(*=), divide and assign(/=).\n",
    "    e) MEMBERSHIP OPERATORS - check if a value is a member of sequence. e.g- list, tuple, string.\n",
    "    There is in and not in membership operators, where 'in' returns True if the value is found in the sequence and 'not in' returns True if the value is not found in the sequence.\n",
    "    f) IDENTITY OPERATORS - check if two variables refer to the same object in memory.(is- returns True if both variables refer to the same object; is not- returns True if both variables refer to different objects.)\n",
    "    g) BITWISE OPERATORS - perform bitwise operations on integers.\n",
    "     AND (&), OR(|), XOR(^), NOT (~), Left shift(<<) - shifts the bits of the left operand to the left, right shift(>>) - shifts the bits of the left operand to the right."

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Answer - \n",
    "    Python's conditional statements carry out various calculations or operations according to whether a particular boolean condition is evaluated as True or False and control the flow of program. It allow us to make decision in code, which make code more efficient and easier to read.\n",

    " Answer - \n",
    "    In python, loops are used to execute a block of code repeatedly until a specific condition is fulfilled. Python offers two primary types of loop i.e., for loop and while loops.\n",
    "    a) for loop - used to iterate over a sequence of elements, like a list, tuple, string, dictionary, or range. Executes a block of code for each item in the sequence.\n",

    "    \n",
    "    c) break - exits the loop prematurely(the condition is met it will exit the loop).\n",
